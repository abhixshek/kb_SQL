SQL is the **most popular language for turning raw data stored in a database into actionable insights.** Using a database of films made around the world, this course covers:
- How to filter and compare data
- How to use aggregate functions to summarize data
- How to sort and group your data
- How to present your data cleanly using tools such as rounding and aliasing

NOTICE how the table names are plural words or plural in sense like `people` table. 
Also notice the field names are singular. 

`COUNT()` 
- counts the no. of records with a value in a field. 
- always use an alias for `count()` for clarity

````SQL
SELECT COUNT(birthdate) AS count_birthdates
FROM people;

-- you can use COUNT() multiple times
SELECT COUNT(name) AS count_names, COUNT(birthdate) AS count_birthdates
FROM people;
````

| count_names | count_birthdates |
|------------ | ---------------- |
|6397 | 6152 |

**NOTE:** the count is different for each field, even though the total no. of rows would be technically same for both fields in the table. **This implies that NULL is not counted** in `COUNT()`

`COUNT(*)` - counts records in a table. 
`*` represents all fields. 

````SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM people;

-- 8397
````

Use `COUNT(DISTINCT field_name)` to count distinct values in the field only. 
````SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate) AS count_distinct_birthdates
FROM people;

-- 5398
````

**Order of execution in SQL:**
Before SQL can fetch any data, it needs to know where to fetch it `FROM`. 
then our `SELECT`ion is made. and then further refinements like `LIMIT`

**SQL formatting:**
New lines, indentation, capitalization are NOT REQUIRED in SQL. 
Semicolon ; is also NOT REQUIRED in PostgreSQL. However, including a ; at the end of the query is considered best practice because 1. some SQL flavors require it, therefore it is better to get into a habit of adding it, 2. if your file contains multiple queries, semicolon ; helps identify the end of each of your queries. 

**NOTE:** It is possible to create field name with a space in it, ex: `release year`
This is a non-standard way of naming fields but in case you come across such a field name given by someone else in your team, you will have to include it in double quotes when querying it in order for SQL to treat it as a single entity rather than two. ex:
````SQL
SELECT "release year"
FROM films;
````


**Filtering / WHERE clause:**
`WHERE` clause is used to filter the results to answer your business question. 

Some commonly used comparison operators in a WHERE clause are:
`=,<=, >=, <, >, <> (not equal to)`

Order of execution for a query like below would be:
````SQL
SELECT item
FROM closet
WHERE color = 'green'
LIMIT 5;
````

```
1. FROM
2. WHERE
3. SELECT
4. LIMIT
```

3 important operators used in a `WHERE` clause:
`OR, AND, BETWEEN`
````SQL
-- OR: returns rows where atleast one of the criteria is satisfied 
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 2014
  OR release_year = 2020;
  
-- AND: returns rows where both the criteria are satisfied
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1994
AND release_year < 2000;

-- when combining OR, AND conditions, it may be required to enclose individual conditions in parenthesis for semantics 
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
  AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');

-- BETWEEN provides an alternative to a long AND condition
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year
  BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000;


````

**NOTE:** `BETWEEN` is inclusive. So the results contain films including 1994 and 2000
![[Pasted image 20231001002951.png]]

````SQL
-- films released between 1994 and 2000 and their country is UK
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year
  BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000 AND country = 'UK';
````
